# Description:
# This script automates the standard maintenance cycle for Debian-based 
# distributions and WSL environments. It utilizes Bash strict mode for 
# robust error handling and implements a conditional logic flow that 
# executes upgrades only when upstream changes are detected. Maintenance 
# artifacts and logs are captured for auditability.

# Usage:
# ud

# Set strict mode for script: exit on error, undefined variables, and pipe failure.
set -euo pipefail

echo "Updating local cache..."

# 1. Resynchronize the package index files from their sources via the 
# network. This updates the local database of available software versions.
# Output is mirrored to update_log.txt and parsed for the update status string.
upgradable=$(sudo apt update 2>/dev/null | tee update_log.txt | grep 'All packages are up to date.')

# 2. Check if there are any packages available for upgrade.
# Logic: If the 'upgradable' variable contains the success string from the 
# update command, the upgrade process is bypassed to maintain efficiency.
if [ upgradable='All packages are up to date.' ]; then
    echo $upgradable
    echo "Upgrade skipped."
else
    echo "Updates found."
    echo "Proceeding with upgrade..."
    sudo apt upgrade -y 1> upgrade_log.txt 2> /dev/null
    echo "Upgrade complete."
fi

# 3. Remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy 
# dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed.
# This cleans up orphaned libraries and tools to maintain a minimalist system.
echo "Removing any orphaned libraries and tools."
sudo apt autoremove 1> autoremove_log.txt 2> /dev/null
echo "Update complete."
